# Wine-quality-classification

Wine classification is a difficult task since taste is the least understood of the human senses. A good wine quality prediction can be very useful in the certification phase, since currently the sensory analysis is performed by human tasters, being clearly a subjective approach.

An automatic predictive system can be integrated into a decision support system, helping the speed and quality of the oenologist performance. Furthermore, a feature selection process can help to analyze the impact of the analytical tests. If it is concluded that several input variables are highly relevant to predict the wine quality, since in the production process some variables can be controlled, this information can be used to improve the wine quality.
